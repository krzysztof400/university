// a binary relation is a total order when:
// 1. it is partial order
    // 1.1 it is reflective that is a <= a
    // 1.2 it is transitive that is a <= b and b <= c implies a <= c
    // 1.3 it is antisymmetric that is a <= b and b <= a implies a = b

// 2. for all a, b in A, exactly one of a < b, a = b, or a > b holds

and so on, you can find defenitions in logic courses
