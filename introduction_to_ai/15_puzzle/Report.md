## Experiment Report for board initialised by 20 random moves

### Heuristic: Misplaced Tiles
- Average steps: 18.26
- Average visited states: 1244.96
- Average solution time: 0.00939545 s

### Heuristic: Manhattan Distance
- Average steps: 18.26
- Average visited states: 113.41
- Average solution time: 0.000829156 s

### Conclusion
- Both heiristics found most likely the same path. Board was generated by making 20 steps from solved state, and Heuristics managed to on average find path that is shorter.
- Misplaced tiles visited around 10 times more states and we see the same incriment in average solution time.
